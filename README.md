linkedin-profile
================

Simple node script to get and show my linkedin profile. Because, you'd expect this. And since you're here...

* [My github profile](https://github.com/Jakobo) offers a good perspective on some of the code I write
* [felocity.com](http://www.felocity.com) is my personal site, which contains a good overview of who I am
* [My LinkedIn Today](https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/5276101-Jakob-Heuser) section contains some posts from felocity, with good discussion on the topics
* And in case you didn't find this from my linkedin profile, [you can always check that out too](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jakobheuser)
